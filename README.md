# Introduction
This program simulates the maximum flow through a network with the [push-relabel maximum flow algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm).

# Manual
1. Download the most recent [release](https://github.com/LevinHinder/Push-Relabel-Maximum-Flow-Algorithm/releases) or, clone the whole repository.
2. Run *Maximum_Flow.exe*
3. Create your custom network. To do so, select in the top left corner the element you want to place. Note: you need at least one start and one end node. By clicking on the screen, you can place your desired element. You can rearrange by drag and drop or delete by selecting the element and pressing the `delete` key.

5. In the next step you can create eges by clicking on one and then on a second node. The direction of the edge is indicated by the arrow and is alwas from the first to the second node. Note that it is not possible for an edge to flow into a start node or out of an end node. You can delete an edge by selecting it and pressing the `delete` key.
